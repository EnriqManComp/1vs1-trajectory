# 1vs1-trajectory (In Progress ...)
This is a project where a player tries to follow a trajectory given by another player. The players play in a define environment and rules.

# Trajectories
- The blue player can be follow a line trajectory

# Encoders
- 

# Problems
- The visualization (so the data is inverted compared with the pygame visualization)
- Distance or Binary representation
- All obstacles with -1 value
- THe 'fors' that run over the planes for fill with the 1's can get out of range
<<<<<<< HEAD
- Out of range in planes
- Stop evasor before out of range or have a collision

# TO DO
- Turn play
- Know the valid movement a priori.
- check evasor collision
- Save data
=======
- Out of index in planes
